## 🕹️ Game Modes

### ⚔️ Vanilla

Just like the original game, but now with friends. Everyone has their own sword, their own body, and their own bad decisions.

### 🤪 Co-op Chaos

One player controls the **movement**, the other controls the **sword**. Work together (or against each other) to get as deep as possible.

> Yes, it’s as chaotic as it sounds.

You can choose your game mode when hosting a lobby.
